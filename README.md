# Behavioral Experimentation & Data Analysis on Self-Referential Language and Cognitive Control

This repository contains the code, stimuli, and analysis scripts for a study investigating how **self-referential information (e.g., “my green”) influences cognitive control** in conflicting situations. We used a **modified Color Stroop Task** with transliterated Malayalam words to explore the interaction between self-reference, congruency, and reaction times.

## Overview

- **Experimental Paradigms**:  
  - **Trial-wise**, **block-wise**, and **proportion-manipulated** designs (>200 trials per participant).  
  - Includes a **Lexical Decision Task (LDT)** to validate equivalence between Malayalam script and transliterated words.  

- **Tools Used**:  
  - Task building: [PsychoPy](https://www.psychopy.org/) (desktop) and [jsPsych](https://www.jspsych.org/) (web/HTML).  
  - Data analysis: Python (`pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`) and R (`ANOVA`, `t-tests`, `Levene’s test`).  
  - Power simulations in Python for sample size adequacy.
